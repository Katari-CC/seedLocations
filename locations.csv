There's an outpost of excellent food and kitchenware shop Akomeya in the basement and a line-up of posh takeaway vendors on the 2nd-floor terrace (where you can sit and eat).",139.699734,35.688524,https://lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/139aa5cea2d16766f775dc65b7d276ff-lpl-00555.jpg?fit=crop&w=320&h=140
Restaurants,Kagaya,"It is safe to say that there is no other restaurant owner in Tokyo who can match Mark Kagaya for brilliant lunacy. His side-splitting antics are this humble izakaya's star attraction, although his mum's nourishing home cooking also hits the spot. Bookings are essential.",139.75605,35.666379,
Restaurants,Rose Bakery Marunouchi,Tokyo has taken to organic cafe Rose Bakery's no-fuss style of dining. Vegetarians and those with a love for British cakes and baked goods are well served at this branch that shares space with a Comme des Garçons boutique.,139.762402,35.678904,
Nightlife,Imasa,"It's not every day you get to sip your coffee or tea in a cultural property. Imasa is the real deal, an old timber merchant's shophouse dating from 1927 but with Edo-era design and detail, and a few pieces of contemporary furniture. Very few houses like this exist in Tokyo or are open to the public.",139.767315,35.701777,https://lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/53d4a1fca39f977e009b33b5e17ac4a3-lpl-img_0611.jpg?fit=crop&w=320&h=140
Attractions,Shibuya Center-gai,"Shibuya's main drag is closed to cars and chock-a-block with fast-food joints and high-street fashion shops. At night, lit bright as day, with a dozen competing soundtracks (coming from who knows where), wares spilling onto the streets and strutting teens, it feels like a block party – or Tokyo's version of a classic Asian night market.",139.699241,35.66019,
Nightlife,Forest Beer Garden,"Following a long-standing Tokyo summer tradition, this corner of Meiji-jingū Gaien becomes a loud and lively beer garden with seating for 1000 around a grand, century-old tree. Reserve ahead for two hours of all-you-can-eat-and-drink barbecue and beer (men/women ¥4200/3900, discounted for kids). Closed in the event of heavy rain.",139.719658,35.67879,
Restaurants,Shishimaru Shokudō,"The house speciality at this eccentric shack-like joint in the shadow of Tokyo Sky Tree is te-uchi udon (handmade wheat noodles); other dishes to sample include tori-ten (chicken tempura) and kurokke (deep-fried potato croquettes). There's homemade umeshu (plum wine), too. Look for the orange awning out the front.",139.81523,35.711692,
Entertainment,Oiwake,"Oiwake is one of Tokyo's few minyō izakaya, pubs where traditional folk music is performed. It's a homey place, where the waitstaff and the musicians – who play tsugaru-jamisen (a banjo-like instrument), hand drums and bamboo flute – are one and the same. Sets start at 7pm and 9pm; children are welcome for the early show. Seating is on tatami.",139.791144,35.717606,
Nightlife,Mugimaru 2,"This old house, completely covered in ivy, is a charmer with a welcoming owner and two of Tokyo's most famous shop cats. Seating is on floor cushions; warm, squishy manjū (steamed buns) are the house speciality. It’s in a tangle of alleys just off Ōkubo-dōri; you'll know it when you see it.",139.738573,35.702335,
Restaurants,Tempura Kondō,"Nobody in Tokyo does tempura vegetables like chef Kondo Fumiō. The carrots are julienned to a fine floss; the corn is pert, juicy; and the sweet potato is comfort food at its finest. Courses include seafood too, picked up that morning from Tsukiji. Lunch service at noon or 1.30pm; last dinner booking at 8pm. Reserve ahead.",139.763131,35.671173,
Restaurants,Gochisō Tonjiru,"Tonjiru, a home-cooking classic, is a hearty miso soup packed with root veggies (such as burdock root, daikon, potato and carrot) and chunks of pork. At this neighbourhood hangout, styled more like a bar than a restaurant, the pork comes in the form of melting-off-the-bone barbecued spare ribs. Choose between a Kyoto-style light miso or a Tokyo-style dark miso.",139.702245,35.682799,
Attractions,Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum,How did baseball come to be a Japanese obsession? This museum chronicles baseball’s rise from a hobby imported by an American teacher in 1872 to the Japanese team winning the bronze medal at the 2004 Olympics. There's also a hall of fame. Diehard fans of the game will want to see it and should pick up the comprehensive English-language pamphlet.,139.752681,35.705593,
Restaurants,Onigiri Yadoroku,"Onigiri (rice balls), wrapped in crispy sheets of nori (seaweed), are a great Japanese culinary invention. Try them freshly made at Tokyo's oldest onigiri shop, which feels more like a classy sushi counter. The set lunches are a great deal; at night there's a large range of flavours to choose from, along with alcohol.",139.794674,35.716901,
Entertainment,Setagaya Public Theatre,"Setagaya Public Theatre, comprising of a main stage and the smaller, more experimental Theatre Tram, is the city's top venue for contemporary drama and dance. Particularly accessible to non-Japanese speakers is the theatre's series on modern nō (a stylised Japanese dance-drama, performed on a bare stage); butoh (an avant-garde form of dance) is also sometimes staged here.",139.670134,35.643809,

Restaurants,Shirube,"It's easy to see why everyone loves this izakaya (Japanese pub-eatery): the young chefs put on a dramatic show in the open kitchen and the creative takes on classics, while not exactly gourmet, are totally satisfying, especially the house speciality, aburi saba (blow-torch grilled mackerel). The two-hour all-you-can-drink course (¥4000), which comes with seven dishes, is great value. ¥400 cover; reservations recommended.",139.667258,35.660321,
